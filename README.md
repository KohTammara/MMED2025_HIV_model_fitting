# HIV Model fitting for evaluating interventions: A simulation exercise

## Project information
- It is important to evaluate interventions, and important to know how well you can do this evaluation
- Practise estimating model parameters through calibration of a model to data, and translating them into useful measures and reporting based on counterfactuals (with uncertainties)
- Through a simulation-based exercise, so that you: (1) know what the ‘true’ answer is, and (2) can study the performance of the estimation over thousands of repeats

Proposed context: estimate the effect of an intervention (measured as, for example, cases/deaths averted) using a dynamical model, as a continuation of / inspired by the HIV in Harare tutorial.

### Goals
How estimation of intervention effectiveness (e.g. bias, confidence interval coverage) is impacted by 
- types and amounts of calibration data from studies (prevalence, incidence, …) 
- how remaining unknown parameters are handled (and whether parameter values are correct)
- (mis)alignment / simplifications of “real” versus model worlds
- (mis)alignment about actual and assumed observation process

### Research Question
How does the performance (bias, coefficient of variation/relative standard error, confidence interval/region coverage) of different estimation approaches (MLEmaximum likelihood  versus least squares) compare, on the estimation of the effect of an intervention, under different scenarios on available prevalence data, as assessed in a simulation exercise?
